Shellys have been a core component in my smart home setup. Controlling everything from lights, rbg strips and now also the door bell notification and garage door sensor

## Garage Door Sensor

After installing the HÃ¶rmann ProMatic3 I wanted to also retrieve the status of the door to make sure it is closed at night or be alarmed when it is opend when it should not be. 
To my suprise this has been pretty straight forward. 

Since the shelly comes with the 24v-60v DC option active by default there is nothing we need to change

### Hardware Setup
Connecting the power supply
The ProMatic3 offers a direct powersupply thru the board itself. Just connect the L(-) -> 20 and N(+) -> 5
To also get a status about the current state of the gate you need to flip the the DL Button 2 to "ON". This is "OFF" by default
DL Button 2 controlls if the "End position message" should be triggered when the gate is closed
Just connect the SW to the 0V terminal. 

I did not connect the O/I ports to actually controll the gate with my shelly. If you would like to connect the O and I to the terminal as show below. The order does not matter

### Homeassistant integration
If you now connect your shelly to HA you will recieve the status and can controll your gate. There is only one issue. The information is somewhat missleading in HA since it will show "ON" for closed and "OFF" for open. 
To fix that you can open up the Shelly App and change the setting "Reverse Input"

I also added a custom binary sensor to translate ON and OFF to OPEN and Close

```
 - platform: template
    sensors:
      sensor_name:
        value_template: '{% if states.{sensor}.state %}
          {% if states.{sensor}.state == "on" %}
            Open
          {% else %}
            Closed
          {% endif %}
          {% else %}
          n/a
          {% endif %}'
        friendly_name: 'friendly sensor name'
```
