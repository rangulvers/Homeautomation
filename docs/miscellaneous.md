### Fun Stuff

After playing around with my overall setup for a while I thought it would be time to also have some fun with my smart home. For this I have created python script to control all Shellyâ€™s (that are connected to a light) to turn on and off in sync to the music. You can find the projekt here [rangulvers/shelly_music](https://github.com/rangulvers/shelly_music)
